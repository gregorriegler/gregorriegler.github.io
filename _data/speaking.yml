    In this episode of the [Mob Mentality Show](https://www.youtube.com/@mobmentalityshow),
    I talked about "Mobbing on the [Open Source Mob RPG](https://github.com/gregorriegler/mob-programming-rpg)".
    We start by discussing the origin story of the app and the weekly public mob session
    to work on it. We also cover examples of fun, surprising, and innovative remote mob
    sessions, as well as a walkthrough of the app page by page. We then dive into the tech
    stack, tools, and collaboration methodology used in the app's development.

    Gave an Ensemble Programming workshop facilitating a huge Ensemble of 80 people
    together with [Lev Konstantinovskyi](https://twitter.com/teagermylk) at the
    [PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2023](https://2023.pycon.de/). The participants excelled
    both in solving the [Real-Estate-Kata](https://github.com/Real-Estate-Kata/real-estate-pydantic-kata)
    and providing mutual support to one another. They initiated a clap-on-green behavior
    and maintained it even after splitting into smaller ensembles.
