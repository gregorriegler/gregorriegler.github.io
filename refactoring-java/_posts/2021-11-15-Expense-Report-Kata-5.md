Here I am working on the Expense Report Refactoring Kata.
I like it because of its small size.
For me, the kata is about making focused refactorings. 
In this episode I have already completed the challenge of the kata, and refactor the code even further. 
I am tackling primitive obsession. 
It is the final video in the expense report series.
