I am starting to work on the Expense Report Refactoring Kata.
I like it because of its small size. For me, the kata is about making focused refactorings. 
In this video I will walk you over the code, and create a first test skeleton using [ApprovalTests for Java](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Java).
