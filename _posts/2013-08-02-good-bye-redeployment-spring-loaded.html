Redeem yourself from hot deployments and OutOfMemoryException. <a href="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-loaded">spring-loaded</a> is an opensource classreloader and a promising alternative to <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/">JRebel</a>. It does not offer as many features as JRebel does, and it does not support any framework just yet. Nevertheless, its a great tool that can save the time you are waiting for that servletcontainer to restart again.<br /><br />What it can do:<br /><ul><li>add/modify/delete methods/fields/constructors</li><li>modify annotations on types/methods/fields/constructors</li><li>add/remove/change values in enum types </li></ul>What it cant:<br /><ul><li>support framework specific changes like Spring MVC @RequestMappings</li><li>change log configuration on the fly</li></ul>It is not getting the attention that it deserves, so give it a try.<br /><br />Just download from <a href="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-loaded">github</a> already, and add the following to your JVM parameters:<br /><pre><code>java -javaagent:&lt;pathTo&gt;/springloaded-{VERSION}.jar -noverify</code></pre>
