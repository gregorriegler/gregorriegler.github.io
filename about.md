i am a software crafter with ~15 years of experience.
i have been working as a developer, tech lead and software architect, but i mostly like to help others become better.
i enjoy reading tech books, watching tech talks, visiting/running code retreats, continuous learning and practice.
i do have a passion for technical agile practices, and i learned creating good software the hard way.
