i am a software crafter with ~15 years of experience.
i am passionate about technical excellence because **you're only as agile as your code** is.
i love continuous learning, sharing, experimenting and practice.

as a developer i value testability, small batches and fast feedback.
this leads me to tdd, simple design, evolutionary design, trunk based development, continuous integration and deployment.
i typically do **a lot** of refactoring.  
i like my design to be oo while embedding fp concepts, and i value explicitness over annotation magic.
