i am a software crafter with ~15 years of experience.
i am passionate about technical excellence because **you're only as agile as your code** is.
i love continuous learning, sharing, experimenting and practice.

as a developer i value low risk â†’ automation, testability, small batches and fast feedback.
this leads me to tdd, simple & evolutionary design, trunk based development, continuous integration and deployment.
i typically do **a lot** of refactoring.
