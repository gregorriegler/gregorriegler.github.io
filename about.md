ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a Software Development Coach and Crafter on a lifelong journey to learn better ways to develop quality software. I like to practice with friends and teach and share what I learned. My goal is to help people find joy in their work and become better at developing software.
And I do all of this remotely.

## Typically, this involves some of the following skills
- Test Driven Development
- Legacy Code Refactoring
- Modular Software Design
- Domain-driven Design
- Software Architecture 
- Mob Programming
- Pair Programming
- eXtreme Programming
- Agile Software Development
- Lean Thinking
- Continuous Delivery
