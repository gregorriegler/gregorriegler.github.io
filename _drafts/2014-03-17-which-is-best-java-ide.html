I'm sorry for all the devs who came here and expected to read something like 'X is the best Java IDE, because ...'. Well i could've wrote such a post, but it would not have made any sense, at least not to all of you. It's just silly to call an IDE the "best", when in reality it is just another opinion. There is no ultimatively best IDE. Every IDE has its own features and characteristics. And every developer has his own preferences in terms of attributes that he considers 'good'. An attribute, that one considered a weakness, could be a strength to another one, and the other way round.<br />Those preferences infer from a unique personal history of programming that evolved a unique net of knowledge and feelings that dictate their own definition of comfortable.<br /><br />One might've used eclipse for a century, experiencing all kind of awkward behaviours, &nbsp;found the solution to all of them, love the features, the modularity, the plugin ecosystem. He is a master in his IDE, and he loves it. To him, eclipse is the best IDE.<br /><br />Another one has found Netbeans as an alternative. It did all he expected, and he learned it rather quick. The code completion was slightly better than in eclipse, and he all plugins that he required were built-in in Netbeans. To him, netbeans was the best IDE.<br /><br />A Company has a big amount of devs, and a big code base. They don't want a dev to see or be able to change any code but the code that is assigned to him in a task. They like to control things, they like to keep devs dumb. they found this plugin called MyLyn. So they use eclipse. To them, eclipse is the best IDE.<br /><br />There is this guy with a sysadmin background. The commandline is his world where he can do things we can't even imagine. He uses VIM as an IDE, because the separation of modes combined with buffers and the great amount shortcuts make such a boost of speed in his trained hands. To him, VIM is the best IDE<br /><br />Every developer has to decide for himself, what IDE makes himself feel most comfortable with.
