One purpose of a school is to transfer knowledge from the adepts to the amateurs, so that those amateurs would one day become adepts themselves, and eventually continue the loop. I see this as a chain of communication which continues throughout generations.<br />Every communication involves a sender, a message and a recipient. Since we're humans, not machines, our communication never involves a faultless transfer of the message. We interpret things, we imagine things, we change the message, every time. Sometimes, we happen to learn something new regarding the message, like a scientific breakthrough, and we alter it. At another time, we don't understand what we are told, so we just remember empty phrases. Often, the sender fails to see things from the recipients perspective, and is just unable to put together a reasonable message. So, knowledge evolves through inter-human communication and its errors, whereas every communication can be seen as an iteration.<br /><br />Now lets imagine for a moment what exams do to this knowledge.<br /><br />We use an exam as a function that tells how good somebody is in a specific field. For a school, this function can be of utter importance as it divided knowledge into layers, where if you don't understand one layer, it is not feasible to learn about the next layer.  Exams are dysfunctional as it suggests that the examiner already knows all the answers.  Exams don't reveal good programmers nor help making them.  Exams are the function that define what our upcoming generations will be like.  As it is always the older generations that design exams, it is obviously a conflict of generations.  Timeframed exams
