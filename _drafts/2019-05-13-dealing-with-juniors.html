According to the 2018 stackoverflow survey a third of all developers have less than 3 years experience. More than half of all developers have less than 6 years of experience. No wonders, while we had like a couple programmers worldwide in the fifties, we reached 23 million developers in 2018<br /><br />story of only juniors in a project<br /><br />why: damage reduction , cost of change<br /><br />cost of accidental complication&nbsp; <br /><br />coding easy to learn, hard to master<br /><br />Ever increasing need of developers,&nbsp; worldwide problem<br /><br /><br />bad seniors<br /><br />hard to detect good seniors<br /><br />pair and teach juniors without asking for permission<br /><br />Train them<br /><br />healthy proportion of juniors vs seniors in a team<br /><br />you want devs who care, and devs who care will go where juniors are dealt with<br /><br />if you don't care, you will get the devs who dont care<br /><br /><br /><br /><span class="inline_editor_value" id="__w2_wtm5JVcK4_answer_content"><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext">According to Wikipedia Ada Lovelace (Cambridge Mathematics Professor) she was the first one who wrote Computer Program in 1843 , the first algorithm was destined to be executed by a Computer machine, even before it exist,</span></span><br /><span class="inline_editor_value" id="__w2_wtm5JVcK4_answer_content"><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext">1843: 1 programmer</span></span><br /><span class="inline_editor_value" id="__w2_wtm5JVcK4_answer_content"><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext">https://www.quora.com/Who-was-the-first-programmer-1 </span></span><br /><br />But in 1974 the number of programmers worldwide was vastly smaller, and probably numbered less than 100,000[3]. That implies that in 40 years our ranks have increased by a factor of 220. Thatâ€™s a growth rate of 14.5% per year, or a doubling rate of five years.<br />https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/06/20/MyLawn.html <br /><br /><br />20 million developers<br />The most commonly estimated figure in various software developer statistics is 20 million developers. Meanwhile in 2014, IDC calculated that there were approximately 18.5 million programmers worldwide.<br />https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjg5-Xl05XiAhUJ06YKHYSGBYsQFjADegQIChAL&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.daxx.com%2Fblog%2Fdevelopment-trends%2Fsoftware-developer-statistics-2017-programmers&amp;usg=AOvVaw3FRRt_XJFyteINE9ttw8JK<br /><br /><br /><br />2014: IDC believes that there are approximately 18.5 million software developers in the world right now.<br />https://adtmag.com/Blogs/WatersWorks/2014/01/Worldwide-Developer-Count.aspx <br /><br /><br />https://www.quora.com/Approximately-how-many-programmers-are-there-in-the-world<br /><span class="inline_editor_value"><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"></span></span><br /><div class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start"><b>In 2017</b> the number of developers in the world reached <b>21 million</b> according to Evans Data Corporation, which regularly conducts in-depth surveys of the global developer population.
